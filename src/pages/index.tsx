        <h2>Welcome to the Personal Values Self-Assessment</h2>
        <p className="font-bold">
          The Personal Values Questionnaire is based on the theory of personal
          values developed by the social psychologist Shalom Schwartz and
          colleagues and which has been empirically tested in more than 80
          countries.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of the questionnaire you will receive an automatically
          generated personal values assessment. This can help you understand:
          which personal values are most important to you, and how your values
          differ from an average EU citizen.
        </p>
        <p>
          This self-assessment tool is part of an initiative by the European
          Commission's Joint Research Centre to help policymakers in the
          European Institutions and EU Member States deliver better policies by
          knowing their own values priorities and potential blind spots.
        </p>
        <p>
          No policymaker? You can of course take the self-test just the same.
